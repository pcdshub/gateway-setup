Note:
All configuration is under the config directory now.
The gateway files on pscag are also mounted at /reg/d/pscag
so you can see and update them without logging into pscag.

However, to restart a gateway, you still need to ssh to
pscag and run the appropriate restart script.
Ex.
pscag:% sudo /u1/gateway/cds/gateway.restart
